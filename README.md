## SQLite Handler

This is a project to handle SQLite.  It provides `make` goals for that.

I use a graphical DB editor, to edit the database.

### Out of Scope

  * Data: it should not live here. This is a generic handler
  * Validation: if it can live in the DB schema, it does not belong here. If it does not fit into a DB schema, it does not belong here either
